# Extract a list of every followers of one or many Instagram profile(s)

If you want to have more followers on Instagram, you need to know which crowd would be interested in you and your content. 

These interesting people are probably already following some influencers or brands. 

This API does the hard job of going through a list of people you like and extracts all their followers. 

This is the first step in building a follow/unfollow strategy and having more targeted, active, real followers on Instagram.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommendations

Instagram limits the amount of followers you can extract over a period of time. It's called the *rate limit*. On Instagram after scraping **9000 followers** you'll need to wait for about **15min** before being allowed to scrape again. 

Re-launching the API will simply trigger a 'Rate Limit reached' error from Instagram. In order to schedule launches, go to the [Repetition Setup step](#repetition_setup) section.

## ‚è≥ Execution speed

This API will extract 9000 profiles **in about 2 minutes**. As mentioned above, you can not extract more than about 9000 profiles every 15min.

# How to start extracting Followers step-by-step.

## 0. Necessary information 

To start using Instagram Follower Extractor, you'll need:

- An **"Instagram account or Spreadsheet URL "**: In order to know **_who_ to extract from**, Phantombuster needs an _input_. This input can either be a single Instagram handle such as https://instagram.com/phantombuster or a spreadsheet with one account URL per row. We recommend using Google Spreadsheet to build this input file. Click on Share the URL to make it publicly accessible to Phantombuster.

- **"Session cookie"**: This is your Twitter `auth_token` session cookie. You'll have more details in Step 5 of this tutorial.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find _Spreadsheet URL_

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Instagram_Profile_Scrapper/inst_prfl_scrrpr_spreadsheet.png)</center>

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Profile URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)
You can also enter a single Instagram profile URL directly in the field.

## 6. Specify how many followers you want to extract

**Column name from which to get profile URLs**: In case your list of input profiles isn't in the first column of your input spreadsheet, write here the name of the input column. Not 'A' but the name on the first row, _profileUrl_ for example.

**Number of followers to collect per profile**: This is the number of accounts you want to extract per profile in total. If you want to scrape every followers, just leave that field blank.

**Number of profiles to process per launch**: Each time you'll launch an agent, how many profiles should it scrape? Leave that field blank in order to scrape the whole input spreadsheet.

**Name of resulting CSV file**: If you want to, you can specify the name of the file you'll be saving all the followers in.

Don't forget to click on üíæ Save before leaving.

## 7. Launch to try it.
