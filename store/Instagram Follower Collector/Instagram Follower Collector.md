# Extract a list of every followers of one or many Instagram profile(s)

If you want to have more followers on Instagram, you need to know which crowd would be interested in you and your content. 

These interesting people are probably already following some influencers or brands. 

This API does the hard job of going through a list of people you like and extracts all their followers (up to around 500k profiles per result file).

This is the first step in building a follow/unfollow strategy and having more targeted, active, real followers on Instagram.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommendations

Instagram limits the amount of followers you can extract over a period of time. It's called the *rate limit*. On Instagram after scraping **9000 followers** you'll need to wait for about **15min** before being allowed to scrape again. 

Re-launching the API will simply trigger a 'Rate Limit reached' error from Instagram. In order to schedule launches, go to the [Repetition Setup step](#repetition_setup) section.

## ‚è≥ Execution speed

This API will extract 9000 profiles **in about 2 minutes**. As mentioned above, you can not extract more than about 9000 profiles every 15min.
