# How to get every posts out of one or many subreddits?

How to **scrape Reddit** is a pretty common question on the web since Reddit is a *huge* - to say the least - source of content. Reddit is kind enough to provide API points for extracting the latest 1000 posts of a subreddit. But most people don't know how to build their own scraper or connect to API endpoints.

For that reason we built this **Reddit Posts Extractor tool** that will allow anyone to scrape every posts from one or many sub-Reddits.

This data can be extremely useful for monitoring trending topics or curating content for your Twitter feed or your Newsletter. 

Use-cases are endless but one thing is for sure: This is the easiest way to extract a list of posts from many Reddit subreddits. Enjoy!
