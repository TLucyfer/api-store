## 6. Choose what the API should do 
The API can perform 3 specifics actions:
- Follow
- Unfollow
- Unfollow back (Unfollow only if the profile hasn't followed back)

## 7. Configure repetitive launches

Twitter does not tolerate **abusive behaviors**. Autofollowing hundred of profiles over a few minutes is considered abusive.

For that reason, you want to allow intervals between launches:
- This API will **follow** a maximum of **50 accounts per launch**.
- We recommend you **start lower** than that: **10 accounts per launch** is a **safe** value. 
- Don't program more than **10 launches per day** at first.
- Twitter allows a maximum of 1000 follows + unfollows per day.
- Read more about our recommendations in this article. [Build your Following Machine in 5min](https://blog.phantombuster.com/recipe-2-growing-your-twitter-audience-101-easily-build-your-following-machine-in-5-minutes-84efffc0bc).
