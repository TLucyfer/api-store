**Auto-following is still in 2019 _the_ best way to get new followers on Twitter**. People will notify your follow, visit your profile then it's up to you to have quality content to make them follow you back.

Your perfect audience is somewhere on Twitter. They are all following the same key influencers, seeing the same hashtags and liking the same Tweets. Find those people, follow them and turn them into your followers.

This API will do the repetitive work or Following & Unfollowing a list of contacts you're interested in **so you can focus on quality content creation** and **building significant connections**.

# Tutorial üöÄÔ∏è 

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommendations 

‚û°Ô∏è When starting a Follow/Unfollow strategy, you need to **warm your account up**. Like in Email marketing, you have to start with moderate numbers, and slowly increase those until you're

‚û°Ô∏è **Start by following 10 people per launch, 8 times per day** and slowly increase these numbers.

‚û°Ô∏è Be aware that Twitter allows a maximum of 1000 follows per day. [Read more about those rules](https://blog.phantombuster.com/never-get-banned-every-social-networks-limitations-any-digital-marketer-should-know-9276c8eaa13f).

## ‚è≥ Execution speed

This API is capable of adding about **25 profiles per minute**.

## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). We browse the web for you and automate actions so you can focus on what's important.

## 2. Use this API on your account.üëå
Now that you're connected to Phantombuster, Click on the following button (it will open a new tab).

<center><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning callToAction" onclick="useThisApi()">USE THIS API!</button></center>

## 3. Create your Input Spreadsheet
Create a spreadsheet on [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) filled with Twitter profile URLs. Make one profile URL per row, all in column A.

The API will follow each one of those 1 by 1.

üí° In order to build a list of people, you can chain this API with other Phantombuster tools such as [Twitter Follower Extractor](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/4130/twitter-follower-collector) for example. And here is a tutorial to do it: [Extract your competitors' followers](https://blog.phantombuster.com/recipe-3-what-you-want-is-a-targeted-audience-how-to-find-it-on-twitter-54ee61a6ac30).

## 4. Click on Configure me!
You'll now see the 3 configuration dots blinking. Click on them.

## 5. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 6. Choose what the API should do 
The API can perform 3 specifics actions:
- Follow: Will auto follow a list of Twitter accounts.
- Unfollow: Will auto unfollow a list of Twitter accounts.
- Unfollow back (Unfollow only if the profile hasn't followed back): Will auto unfollow the accounts that do not follow your Twitter account.

## 7. Configure repetitive launches

Twitter does not tolerate **abusive behaviors**. Autofollowing hundred of profiles over a few minutes is considered abusive.

For that reason, you want to allow intervals between launches:
- This API will **follow** a maximum of **50 accounts per launch**.
- We recommend you **start lower** than that: **10 accounts per launch** is a **safe** value. 
- Don't program more than **10 launches per day** at first.
- Twitter allows a maximum of 1000 follows + unfollows per day.
- Read more about our recommendations in this article. [Build your Following Machine in 5min](https://blog.phantombuster.com/recipe-2-growing-your-twitter-audience-101-easily-build-your-following-machine-in-5-minutes-84efffc0bc).

To configure Repetitive Launches, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.
