# Extract LinkedIn profiles from emails

Got a list of emails and want to quickly find whose LinkedIn profiles they belong to?
We have a tool for that!

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with emails in it.
- **Keep going when limited**: Past 50 profiles found per day, LinkedIn prevents from getting URLs (without a premium account). With that option the API will keep scraping but will only get the profile's name and not its URL.

_(**You already have all that?**  Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It‚Äôs a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.üëå

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find _Spreadsheet URL_

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_

Add every email in column A (**one link per row**)

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months.

Every time the API is launched, it will process 10 lines of your spreadsheet and then stop. (This number can be changed in the configuration)

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:

Then, select a frequency:

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will visit the profiles found in order to get their URLS.
LinkedIn has set a daily limit for finding profiles from emails, around 50 profiles per day. You may choose to continue the scraping past that point, but the API will only be able to get the profile's name and not its URL.
We have noticed that visiting more than 80 profiles per day will almost always result in LinkedIn **invalidating your session cookie** (that is, logging you out).

Having a LinkedIn Sales Navigator subscription might raise this limit. Please see these official LinkedIn help pages: [Commercial Use Limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950) and [Finding People on LinkedIn](https://premium.linkedin.com/professional/faq).
