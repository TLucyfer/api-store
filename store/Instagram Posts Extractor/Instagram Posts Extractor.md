# Extract every posts from a list of Instagram accounts

Study your competition and use their good ideas, while leaving aside what you don't like that much.

This Instagram automation will visit a list of profiles for you and extract every single post they ever posted. This includes the image/video, but also the stats (likes, etc.), hashtags, engagements, locations and more.

**Keep informed**, **get new ideas**, filter out the stuff that didn't work, **keep the good and discover the channels your competitors are focused on**.
