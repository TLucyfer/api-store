# Who amongst your followers are influencers?
LinkedIn now allows users to see who your followers are and how many followers each of them has. However, as we're looking for influencers, the most valuable info is the number of followers **they have**. 

Because they're not sorted, we have to extract the full list. Doing it by hand would take ages, with this API it will be done in a few minutes. ðŸ™Œ

# Our Solution
Use LinkedIn Followers Insights to **scroll automatically** through your hundreds or thousands of followers. 

You will then retrieve a CSV filed with all of your followers':
- First name
- Last name
- Occupation
- Number of people following them

The CSV is originally indexed accordingly to the number of followers, so you can easily **spot influencers in your network**.
