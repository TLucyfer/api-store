# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

There you go, you only have to wait for endorsement to be made for you!

# Email discovery (optional) { email_discovery }

**Thanks to our friends at [Hunter](https://hunter.io) (an email discovery service), this API can guess the email of each profile it visits.**

To use this feature, first create an account at Hunter [here](https://hunter.io/users/sign_up). Once done, **get your Hunter API key** by going to "Dashboard" > "API" > "Copy API key".

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/hunter-screenshot.png)</center>

Paste your API key in the "Hunter.io API key" field in your API configuration. It will now guess the email of every visited profile! Expect a success rate between 20% and 50%.

Hunter gives you 100 free email guesses per month. After that, you'll have to buy one of their plans or wait a month.

**Important note:** When email discovery is enabled, the API will open LinkedIn company pages to get company domains. For this reason, we recommend you limit your visits to **40 profiles per day**.
