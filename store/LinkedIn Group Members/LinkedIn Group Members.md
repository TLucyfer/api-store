2. Names
3. Current job/position

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Group URL**: The direct link of a LinkedIn group (you **must** be a member of this group).

# How long does that take to set up this amazing hack?
It will take you no more than **3minutes**. üïí

## 3. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 4. Add a LinkedIn group URL üìë {posturl}
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find **Group URL**

Add, in the textbox, the link of the group you want to scrape (once again, you **must be a member** of the group)

You will be able to gather up to 2500 profiles! (this is a limitation from LinkedIn)

## 5. Name your future CSV {csv}
Optionally enter the name of the group you're scraping. This name will be the name of your brand new CSV.

Click on üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span>

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

Once the script has finished his work, download the CSV by clicking on "**Link (download/share)**"
