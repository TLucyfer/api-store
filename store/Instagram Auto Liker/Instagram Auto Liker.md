# Automatically like the pictures of people you're interested in.

Get noticed by the people you're interested in by liking their pictures.

# Our Solution

__You want to like specific Profiles' latest pictures:__
Give us their instagram handles and how many of their latest pictures you want to like (up to 12).

__You want to directly like Pictures:__
Specify those pictures' URLs and we will like those for you.

_It also works with a mix of both._

Once your input file has been completely liked, the tool will restart from zero and like the specified profiles' new pictures.

# Before you start

Automation works better when done responsibly. For that purpose, it's better to follow those simple rules:
- Rather than liking 100's of pics at once, prefer spacing those throughout the day. 
- 3 profiles or 5 posts per launch is a good pace. 
- Wait for 20 minutes between launches. 

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from Instagram.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with Instagram profile URLs or post URLs in it.
- **Number of lines per launch**: The number of profiles or posts to process per launch.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find _Spreadsheet URL_.

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Instagram_Profile_Scrapper/inst_prfl_scrrpr_spreadsheet.png)</center>

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Profile URLs or Post URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a single Instagram profile or post URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of profiles to process per launch, or leave that field blank to process every profile from your list.


To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:
