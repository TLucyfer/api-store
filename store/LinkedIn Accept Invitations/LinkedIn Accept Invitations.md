# Don't waste your time accepting incoming connection requests!
Instead of spending time each day going through the boring process of accepting requests individually, let our API take care of it for you. By doing so, you will be able to spend your time on more important tasks.

# Our solution: Automatically accept requests and receive summary emails
Get your agent accepting **as many connections as you want** at **the speed you want**. Every time your agent is launched, receive a summary email including information of each LinkedIn profile that has been added. This way you can:
- Stay focused.
- Continue growing your network.
- Gain better visibility with each new connection you want to interact with.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Number of connections to accept**: The number of profiles you want to add per launch of the API.

_(**You already have all that?**  Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. How many connections per iteration?
The 2nd parameter you'll need to set is the **number of connections to accept** which means: how many connections do you want the API to add everytime it runs?

Enter a number between 1 and 50 (by default it's **5**). 

## 6. Filter your invitations
The 3rd & 4th parameters (2 checkboxes) will help you to filter out which one you want to accept:

The first checkbox is used to select people <b>who sent you a message</b>
The second one is used to select people <b>who have at least one mutual connection</b> with you

## 7. Add a private personalized message üÜï üí¨
You'll find the **message** configuration (<b>the last parameter<b/>).
This step isn‚Äôt mandatory but highly recommended.

In the message textbox you can write a private note (**Total: 1000 characters MAX**) which will be sent when you accept an invitation.

\#firstName\# will be replaced in your message by the first name of the person who invited you
\#fullName\# will be replaced in your message by the first & last name of the person who invited you
