In the **target field** you'll be prompted for your targets. This can be either *one* domain. Or a Google Spreadsheet URL containing *many* domains.

These domains don't need to necessarily have Intercom. The tool will detect if Intercom is present and if not, go to the next site.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of URLs (one link per row). You can specify the name of the column that contains the links. Simply enter the column name in the field below.

Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!

## 5. Specify your message and the email address you want to receive answers at.

Try to make your message look like you want to start a discussion. Starting by not saying "Hello" and start selling feels really unnatural to the operator and will definitely lower your response rate.

**Don't forget to fill in your email address**. Once a discussion starts on Intercom, you'll receive an email notifying you and can take the discussion from there.
