# If you love me, follow me üíì
We all know those Twitter account with 10x more following than followers, and let's be honest.. we don't want to be there. You already know that you're a wonderful human being & therefore you shouldn't give more love than you receive. üê¶

# Love shouldn't be one-sided
Once with a list of people you follow, Let our API do the work and remove all those accounts who don't follow you back. Their loss!

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **"Spreadsheet URL"**: Link of an open spreadsheet containing a list of twitter profile urls you want to check for followback
- **"Session Cookie auth_token"**: Your Twitter `auth_token` session cookie.

# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It‚Äôs a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.üëå

## 4. Create a nice Spreadsheet
In the 1st argument field paste the URL of a spreadsheet filled with Twitter profile URLs, all **on column A**

The API will check each one of them if they're following you back. If they aren't the API will unfollow them.

## 5. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to Twitter on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.
