# Collect information from any Facebook group

Get to know any Facebook member that shares the same interests as you. Use any Facebook group you have access to and gather:

1. Facebook profile links
2. Names
3. Facebook Unique ID
4. Profile pictures
5. Current job/location

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookies c\_user and xs**: Your _c\_user_ and _xs_ session cookies from Facebook.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with Facebook groups URLs in it, OR the direct link of a Facebook group (unless they're public, you **must** be a member of these groups).
- **Number of members per group**: The number of members you want to collect per group. If left empty, the API will scrape all group members.
- **Number of members per launch**: If you want to scrape all members from a huge single group, you can choose to retrieve the data in several short launches instead of a long one.

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

Since Phantombuster's servers are located on the west coast of the USA, Facebook might to consider those login attempts as unusual activities. It's likely that they'll then temporarily lock your account and ask you to confirm your login.

In order to use the Facebook APIs to their max potential, we recommend [using a proxy](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/setting-up-a-proxy-with-phantombuster) close to you.

Also there's a limit on how many members we can access from a group (despite the total amount shown by Facebook being way higher). That amount may vary depending on the group you're scraping (~around 10k for a 100k members group).
