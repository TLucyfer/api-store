# Transform any web page into a web service

If a website doesn't provide an API it is still possible to extract data form it automatically!

The powerful Web Element Extractor API helps you to discover and extract data automatically from any web pages and export all of them to a CSV file.

As always, on Phantombuster, **no need to keep your computer on**, everything happens in the cloud :D

# The process is simple

You'll need to define which data you're looking for and the URL where it's stored.

For each website, the API will automatically:
- Locate the data on the page
- Extract the content
- Save the result in a CSV file in the cloud

# What you'll need to set to make it work? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **CSV/ Spreadsheet URLs or URLs to scrape**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with websites URLs or a list of URL set manually.
- **Time to wait until the page is fully loaded**: The API needs to load the entire webpage and it takes time. More the website is complex more time the API needs to wait. Let the default value, it will work like a charm :)
- **Number of URLs to scrape per launch**: The API can be stopped at any time and relaunched later. This option defines the number of websites visited per launch.

_(**You already have all that?** Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_
