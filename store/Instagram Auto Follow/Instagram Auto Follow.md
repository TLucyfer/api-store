Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Profile URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a single Instagram profile URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of profiles to scrape per launch, or leave that field blank to scrape every profile from your list.


To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:
