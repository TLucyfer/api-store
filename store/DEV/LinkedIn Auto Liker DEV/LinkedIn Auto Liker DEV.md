# Automatically Like your Connections' Posts and Articles on LinkedIn

One of the main ways to show appreciation on social networks is to like other peoples' content. Obvious. But as most of us also know, scrolling through feeds can be really time consuming. 

So how to get the best of both worlds? **Set up this LinkedIn Auto Liker automation!** LinkedIn Auto Liker will automatically like a list of posts or the content created by a list of people while you're focused on something else.

Give visibility and reach to your LinkedIn connections or users and influencers you find interesting and auto like their LinkedIn publications. Or use our [LinkedIn Search Export](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/3149/linkedin-search-export) tool that which will create a flow of LinkedIn posts, articles and publications on a theme of your choice, and give that list as an input to this automation so you automatically like each one of those posts and get noticed on LinkedIn.

# Tutorial üöÄ

## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
Not a user yet? Create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our services can automate any action you could pursue on the web yourself and do it on your behalf from the cloud!


## 2. Add this automation to your account.
You can add many APIs on your Phantombuster account as your plan allows. Need more space? Delete an API and switch!

<center><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning callToAction" onclick="useThisApi()">USE THIS API!</button></center>


## 3. Click on Configure me!
You'll now see the 3 configuration dots blinking. Click on them.

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

<div class="row" style="margin: 10px 0px;">
	<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1">
		<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phantombuster/mdlnjfcpdiaclglfbdkbleiamdafilil" 
		target="_blank">
			<div class="btn btn-default text-center" style="display: inline-block; align-items: center;">
				<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
				<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/phantombuster-static/api-store/Browser+Extension/chrome.svg" style="height: 35px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px white">
				Get it for Chrome</p>
			</div>
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1">
		<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/phantombuster/" 
		target="_blank">
			<div class="btn btn-default text-center" style="display: inline-block; align-items: center;">
				<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
				<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/phantombuster-static/api-store/Browser+Extension/firefox.svg" style="height: 35px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px white">
				Get it for Firefox</p>
			</div>
		</a>
	</div>	
</div>

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë

**Spreadsheet URL** is the place where you specify which or whose LinkedIn posts you want to automatically like.

Make a Google Spreadsheet and add Posts URLs or LinkedIn Profiles URLs. 

Add one Post or Profile per row and make sure they are in column A.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

ü§ì Pro tip: If not in the first column, you can specify the name of the column where the URLs are.

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the API and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, send Phantombuster's team LinkedIn connection requests.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you just have to customize it to make it work repetitively.

Every time the API is launched, it will send 10 connection requests and stop. (You can lower this value in the API's configuration.)

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page.

There you go, you only have to wait for connections to be made for you!
