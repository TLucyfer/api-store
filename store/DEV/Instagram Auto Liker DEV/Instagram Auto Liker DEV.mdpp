# Automatically like the pictures of people you're interested in.

Get noticed by the people you're interested in by liking their pictures.

# Our Solution

__You want to like specific Profiles' latest pictures:__
Give us their instagram handles and how many of their latest pictures you want to like (up to 12).

__You want to directly like Pictures:__
Specify those pictures' URLs and we will like those for you.

_It also works with a mix of both._

Once your input file has been completely liked, the tool will restart from zero and like the specified profiles' new pictures.

# Before you start

Automation works better when done responsibly. For that purpose, it's better to follow those simple rules:
- Rather than liking 100's of pics at once, prefer spacing those throughout the day.
- 3 profiles or 5 posts per launch is a good pace.
- Wait for 20 minutes between launches.

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from Instagram.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with Instagram profile URLs or post URLs in it.
- **Number of lines per launch**: The number of profiles or posts to process per launch.
