# Extract info from Instagram posts

You have a list of Instagram posts and need to quickly extract information from them? Don't waste your time copy/pasting anymore. Retrieve all the data you need of the specific Instagram posts you're targeting in a CSV file.

# Our Solution

Launch an automated agent that will browse and collect data from the designated posts.


# What will you need? ⚙️ 

- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with Instagram post URLs in it.

_(**You already have all that?**  Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com 💻
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It’s a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.👌
Now that you're connected to Phantombuster, Click on the following button (it will open a new tab).

## 4. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookie you’ll find _Spreadsheet URL_.

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Posts URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the post links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a single Instagram post URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️ { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of posts to scrape per launch, or leave that field blank to scrape every post from your list.


To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched:

Then, select a frequency:

Don't forget to click 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page!

For example, 100 posts scraped per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll have a total of 800 posts per day. We recommend not exceeding these values with this API as it takes some time to scrape this many posts.
