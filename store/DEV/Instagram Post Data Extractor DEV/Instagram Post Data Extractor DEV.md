If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find _Spreadsheet URL_.

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Posts URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the post links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a single Instagram post URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of posts to scrape per launch, or leave that field blank to scrape every post from your list.


To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

Don't forget to click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page!

For example, 100 posts scraped per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll have a total of 800 posts per day. We recommend not exceeding these values with this API as it takes some time to scrape this many posts.
