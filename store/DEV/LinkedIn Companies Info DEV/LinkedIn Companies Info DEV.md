# Get meaningful data about targeted companies
Starting with a list of companies, you don't always have the time to find info for each one of them. Let our API do the work and collect a CSV with all the data you need.

# Our Solution
Gather company LinkedIn page URLs or Linkedin company IDs and fill a Google Spreadsheet with those. Once done, our agent will browse this spreadsheet and collect meaningful data from the targeted businesses.

# What will you need?
For this API you will just need two arguments:
- **Session Cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: Link to a Google Spreadsheet containing LinkedIn company IDs, LinkedIn company URLs or company names (can be a mix of those).
- **Save the company logo as a jpeg**: If you want to download the company logo. Note that you won't be able to download all the files as a zip if you have more than 1000 files.

# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com ðŸ’»
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. Itâ€™s a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.ðŸ‘Œ

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Google spreadsheet {spreadsheet}
Create a google spreadsheet and fill column A with either: 
- **LinkedIn Company URLs** *like: https://www.linkedin.com/company/phantombuster/*
or
- **LinkedIn company IDs** *like: 5000463*
or
- **Company names** *like: Phantombuster* (in this case, the API will search the company on LinkedIn and use the first search result)

Your spreadsheet can contain a mix of those. Each row will be treated independently.

You can also input a CSV URL instead of a Google Spreadsheet. In all cases, make sure your file is **publicly accessible**!
