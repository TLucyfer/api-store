# You can't invite more people because you have too many pending invitations?
If someone didn't accept your invitation to connect after several weeks, you know for sure he/she doesn't want to talk to you! _(That sounds terrible but remember you're a beautiful human being and you deserve to be loved ‚ù§Ô∏è)_
LinkedIn has many limitations. Among them is the number of pending invites you can stack over time.
Get rid of them and make room for faster growth!

How? Just follow this tutorial üòä


# The solution in a couple of words
Define how many recent invitations you want to keep in your pending list. Then set the execution frequency of your API. That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre all set!

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 
- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Number of invitations to keep**: Value **by default is 1000** which will keep untouched your last 1000 requests. If you want all your invites to be withdrawn just set this value to 0.

# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Keep fresh invites {invitations} 

By default this API will keep your last 1000 connection requests.

You can change this value if you necessary. If you want to withdraw all your invites, set this value to **0**.

## 6. Configure a daily clean up

To never have to worry again about your pending invitations, configure this API to run once daily. To do so, go into its settings, then select _Repetitive launch_, once a day. And click save. That's it!

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!
