## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommendations

Twitter limits the amount of followers you can retrieve over a period of time. It's called the rate limit. In this case after scraping **5000 followers** you'll need to wait for about **90min** before being able to scrape again. 

Re-launching the API during this period simply won't work. Once the rate limit has been lift off, you'll be able to scape again. Go to the [Repetition Setup step](#repetition_setup) to program re-launches.

## ‚è≥ Execution speed

This API will extract 5000 profiles **in about 3 minutes**. Nevertheless Twitter won't allow you to extract more than about 5000 profiles every 90min.

##  6. (Optional) Ô∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:
