# Scrape Twitter and extract every single piece of media content off a list of Twitter accounts.

Let's say you follow a few people whose Twitter are a goldmine of cool videos & images. Or maybe you want to do some business intelligence and keep an eye on what your competitors are publishing.

Give us a list of these people and **we will extract the URLs** where each piece of content is hosted for you. And everything about it at the precise moment: **viewcounts, durations, description**, etc. What you do with this content is up to you.

## Set this Twitter automation on repeatÔ∏è { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of profiles to process per launch, or leave that field blank to process every profile from your list.

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched:

For example, 10 profiles processed per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll process a total of 80 profiles per day.

## Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!
