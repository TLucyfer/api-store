# Collect information from any Facebook group

Get to know any Facebook member that shares the same interests as you. Use any Facebook group you have access to and gather:

1. Facebook profile links
2. Names
3. Profile pictures
4. Current job/location

# What will you need? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookies c\_user and xs**: Your _c\_user_ and _xs_ session cookies from Facebook.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with Facebook groups URLs in it, OR the direct link of a Facebook group (unless they're public, you **must** be a member of these groups).
- **Number of members per group**: The number of members you want to collect per group. If left empty, the API will scrape all group members.
- **Number of members per launch**: If you want to scrape all members from a huge single group, you can choose to retrieve the data in several short launches instead of a long one.
