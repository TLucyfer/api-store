## 4. Instagram authentication 🔑 { argument }
Because the script will manipulate Instagram for you, it needs to be logged on your Instagram account. For that you just need to copy paste your session cookie in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your Instagram homepage and open the inspector
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)
→ <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS
or
→ <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the “Application” tab

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Instagram Posts URLs (**one link per row**).
You can specify the name of the column that contains the post links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a single Instagram post URL directly in the field.



# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️ { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months. You can also specify the number of posts to scrape per launch, or leave that field blank to scrape every post from your list.


To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched:

Then, select a frequency:
