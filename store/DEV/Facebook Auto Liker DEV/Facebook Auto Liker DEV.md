# All your prospects need is love!
I remember being a superstar because a lot of people liked my posts. Nothing is more rewarding! If you love me, I'll love you in return 😍
Sincerely — Your sweet prospect

# Warm up your Facebook prospects before talking to them
If you want to warm up a prospect on Facebook, you'll have to like their posts. Start with a list of Facebook users and be ready to like their last posts. How many? It depends on how much love you want to spread!

# What will you need? ⚙️

- **Session cookies c\_user and xs**: Your _c\_user_ and _xs_ session cookies from Facebook.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with Facebook profiles URLs in it, the direct link of a Facebook profile, OR the direct link of a Facebook post.
- **Number of likes to send per profile**: The number of likes the API will send, starting by the most recent posts that are still unliked.
- **Number of posts to load per profile**: The number of posts the API will load before trying to like the ones that are still unliked.
- **Number of profiles to process**: The number of profiles you want to process per launch. If left empty, the API will process every profile from your list.

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

Since Phantombuster's servers are located on the west coast of the USA, Facebook might to consider those login attempts as unusual activities. It's likely that they'll then temporarily lock your account and ask you to confirm your login.

In order to use the Facebook APIs to their max potential, we recommend [using a proxy](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/setting-up-a-proxy-with-phantombuster) close to you.
