If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).


## 5. Personalize your message üÜï üí¨
Below the column name you'll find the **message** configuration.

In the message textbox you can write a private note which will be sent to the profile included in your Google spreadsheet.

**\#fbFirstName\#** will be replaced in your message by the first name of the person you‚Äôre adding.
The other tags available are **\#fbName\#** and **\#fbLastName\#**, replaced by their full name and last name.

How about using your own tags ? <b>Simple.</b>
Add a column in your Google Spreadsheet with any informations you want to apply.

For instance:
A column named **greetings** in your Google Spreadsheet will replace all **\#greetings\#** tags in your message.


# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you can customize it to make it work repetitively.

Use to 'Number of profiles to process per launch' field to configure how many profiles you want to scrape per launch (5 for instance will make it 5 profiles each launch then stop). Then set a repetition setup:

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:

There you go, the scraping will be made for you without you doing anything!

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

Since Phantombuster's servers are located on the west coast of the USA, Facebook might to consider those login attempts as unusual activities. It's likely that they'll then temporarily lock your account and ask you to confirm your login.

In order to use the Facebook APIs to their max potential, we recommend [using a proxy](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/setting-up-a-proxy-with-phantombuster) close to you.
