# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è Repetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

If your input spreadsheet has a lot of rows, your Phantombuster account might not have enough execution time to find all the company URLs in a single day. No worries though! You can set up **an automatic launch per day** to continue finding company URLs over weeks or months if necessary.

To do so, first go to your API's settings:

Then, select `Once per day` (or another frequency if you prefer):

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/repetition-setup-once-per-day.png)</center>

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page. That's it! Your API will now add more and more rows to your result CSV file every day, automatically.

Note: You can also [buy more hours per day](https://phantombuster.com/upgrade) to speed up the process!
