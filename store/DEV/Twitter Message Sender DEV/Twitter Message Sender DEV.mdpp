# Automatically send Direct Messages (DM's) on Twitter and massively reach your followers.

Whether you're launching a product, organizing an event, or need to raise awareness, you might want to contact people one-by-one. 

This is super efficient. But it's also something you don't want to do manually.

The Twitter Message Sender is a Phantombuster Twitter automation that's design to save you time. Give it a list of your followers, craft a super copy and get your message out there.

!INCLUDE "./mdpp-sections/section-related-apis-twitter-2.mdpp"

## Best practice:
‚úîÔ∏è Twitter lets you send up to 1000 DM's in a day.
‚è≥ Prefer sending your messages over multiple launches rather than a single big one.

# Tutorial üöÄ
## 1. Create your free Phantombuster account.
<center><a type="button" class="btn btn-success callToAction" href="https://www.phantombuster.com/register" style="margin-top: 20px">SIGN UP</a></center>

## 2. Add this Twitter tool to your account.
<center><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning callToAction" onclick="useThisApi()">USE THIS API!</button></center>

## 3. Click on Configure me!

## 4. Create a nice Spreadsheet
In the "Spreadsheet URL" field, paste the URL of a spreadsheet filled with Twitter profile URLs, all **on column A**.

The API will like tweets of those profiles over time.

If you do not put the profile URLs in the first column, you can specify the name of the column you used thanks to the "Column name" field in the configuration.

To get Twitter profile URLs, you can use our other Twitter APIs such as [Follower Collector](/api-store/4130/twitter-follower-collector), [Following Collector](/api-store/4457/twitter-following-collector) or [Profile URL Finder](/api-store/4485/twitter-profile-url-finder).

## 5. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

## Set this Twitter automation on repeat { repetition_setup }

Twitter official limit is 1000 DM's a day. But in order to keep your account safe, prefer starting with fewer messages and incrementally increase that number.

To set launches on repeat, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:
