# Is Intercom expensive? Save hundreds of dollars on your Intercom bill each month!

Intercom is a great software, no doubts about it. But its pricing can make it really expensive. Particularly for startups getting some traction and having multiple thousands new 'active' users in the pipes.

The good news is that when you archive active users, you can drastically decrease your monthly Intercom expenditures. Drastic like in several hundred dollars off your bill.

# How can I save on my Intercom bill?

It's easy: At Phantombuster we build automations that do specific actions on your behalf on the web. In this case, we're connecting to your Intercom account, archive every user that's been inactive in the last 4 weeks and send you an email with the results.

That way, you're always paying for the lowest plan you need.

And if you schedule this automation, we'll do it for you every month.

## How much does it cost?

With our Free Forever Plan, it's free.

## Why are we doing it?
To show you that automations doing the right actions at the right times have tremendous potential upsides. We hope this we'll be a gateway for you to use our other automations.

## 5. (optional) Create an Intercom Segment

Intercom segments are groups of users fulfilling specific criteria. Create the exact segment of users you want to archive and let Phantombuster know its ID.

[ 2 ] Specify your criteria

[ 3 ] Create the filter

[ 4 ] Save it as a segment

Once created go to the segment and copy/paste its URL. It should look like some variant of this:
`https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/iy3q5eio/users/segments/5a9e93163543373724f93c07`

## 6. Specify an email address to receive your summary at.
