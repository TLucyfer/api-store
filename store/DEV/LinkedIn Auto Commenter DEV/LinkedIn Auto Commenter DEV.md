# Automatically Comment on your Connections' Posts and Articles on LinkedIn

Writing comments on LinkedIn is a powerful way to support your connections or the people you're interested in. Since you might not have the time to be active on LinkedIn, auto commenting is a great way of filling in the gaps. 

The LinkedIn algorithm is really sensitive to comments and by auto commenting on LinkedIn Posts, you'll give them much more reach and visibility.

Pick thoughtfully as many comments as you'd like. Pick users you love or comments related to a specific topic with our [LinkedIn Search Export](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/3149/linkedin-search-export) and automatically those LinkedIn posts, articles or publications.

# Tutorial

## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It‚Äôs a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Add this automation to your account.
You can add many APIs on your Phantombuster account as your plan allows. Need more space? Delete an API and switch!

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë

**Spreadsheet URL** is the place where you specify who or what you want to comment on. 

Make a Google Spreadsheet and add Posts URLs or LinkedIn Profiles URLs. 

Add one Post or Profile per row and make sure they are in column A.

ü§ì Pro tip: If not in the first column, you can specify the name of the column where the URLs are.

## 6. Make a list of comments that'll be randomly picked

You'll need to specify a list of comments in your input spreadsheet. To do so, choose an empty column, name it (by writing `comments` for example in the first row of the column). Then on the rows belows, write each comment, one by line.

Once you're done, get back to Phantombuster and let it know how you called that column.

# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the API and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, send Phantombuster's team LinkedIn connection requests.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you just have to customize it to make it work repetitively.

Every time the API is launched, it will send 10 connection requests and stop. (You can lower this value in the API's configuration.)

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:
