# Tutorial üöÄ

## Recommendations

‚û°Ô∏è When starting a Follow/Unfollow strategy, you need to **warm your account up**. Like in Email marketing, you have to start with moderate numbers, and slowly increase those until you've reach a safe cruising speed.

‚û°Ô∏è **Start by following 10 people per launch, 8 times per day** and slowly increase these numbers.

‚û°Ô∏è Be aware that Twitter allows a maximum of 1000 follows per day. [Read more about those rules](https://blog.phantombuster.com/never-get-banned-every-social-networks-limitations-any-digital-marketer-should-know-9276c8eaa13f).

## Execution speed

This API is capable of adding about **25 profiles per minute**.

## 3. Create your Input Spreadsheet
Create a spreadsheet on [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) filled with Twitter profile URLs. Make one profile URL per row, all in column A.

The API will follow each one of those 1 by 1.

üí° In order to build a list of people, you can chain this API with other Phantombuster tools such as [Twitter Follower Extractor](https://phantombuster.com/api-store/4130/twitter-follower-collector) for example. And here is a tutorial to do it: [Extract your competitors' followers](https://blog.phantombuster.com/recipe-3-what-you-want-is-a-targeted-audience-how-to-find-it-on-twitter-54ee61a6ac30).

## 6. Choose what the API should do 
The API can perform 3 specifics actions:
- Follow: Will auto follow a list of Twitter accounts.
- Unfollow: Will auto unfollow a list of Twitter accounts.
- Unfollow back (Unfollow only if the profile hasn't followed back): Will auto unfollow the accounts that do not follow your Twitter account.

## Set this Twitter automation on repeat { repetition_setup }

Twitter does not tolerate **abusive behaviors**. Autofollowing hundred of profiles over a few minutes is obviously considered abusive.

For that reason, you want to allow intervals between launches:
- This API will **follow** a maximum of **50 accounts per launch**.
- We recommend you **start lower** than that: **10 accounts per launch** is a **safe** value. 
- Don't program more than **10 launches per day** at first.
- Twitter allows a maximum of 1000 follows + unfollows per day.
