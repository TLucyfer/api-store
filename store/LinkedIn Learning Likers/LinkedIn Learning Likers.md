# Get the list of people interested in a LinkedIn Learning Course

LinkedIn recently rolled out its Learning Center. Dedicated to professionals wishing to stay ahead in their careers, it offers a variety of highly specialized courses. 

Thanks to our tool, you will be able to extract a list of people interested (ie. having *Liked*) each course. Very useful for hiring new talents or proposing similar courses. 

Make a list of every course you're interested in and we'll come back to you with:
1. LinkedIn profile links. <i>(can be used with our other API: <a href="https://phantombuster.com/api-store/2818/linkedin-network-booster" target="_blank">LinkedIn Network Booster</a>)</i>
2. Current job/position of every liker.
3. Names of who liked.

# What will you need to get those Learners? ‚öôÔ∏è 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Post URL**: The direct link of a LinkedIn post.
- **CSV name**: The name of the CSV file you'll be creating.

# How long does that take to set up this tool?
You'll be set in less than **2minutes**. üïí

## 3. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.
