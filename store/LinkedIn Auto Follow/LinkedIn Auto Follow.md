<center>**New! This API now supports [email discovery](#section_email_discovery).**</center>

<hr />

# Send notifications to people.

When you follow someone on LinkedIn, a notification is sent to him/her. This is a chance for you to make them visit your profile or, even better, make them follow you back!

Even if they don't, you'll have access to their publications and will be able to extract the list of people who commented and/or liked them.

# Our solution: Make people following you by following them.

Starting from a Google spreadsheet filled with a list of LinkedIn profiles, Phantombuster will follow **automatically** all those profiles.
Also, just a checkbox tick away and you can do just the opposite and unfollow each and everyone of them!

# What you'll need to set to make it work? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet (or CSV) with LinkedIn profile URLs in it.
- **Number of follows per launch**: How many _(between **1** and **10**)_ profiles to follow per launch
- **Unfollow profiles**: If you need to undo what you've done, select this option to unfollow the profiles from your list.

_(**You already have all that?** Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# If it's your first time, follow the full setup process.
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com üíª
If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It‚Äôs a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.üëå
We cooked up in our lab a script with first-class attention.
Now that you're connected to Phantombuster, Click on the following button (it will open a new tab).

<center><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning callToAction" onclick="useThisApi()">USE THIS API!</button></center>


## 3. Click on Configure me!
You'll now see the 3 configuration dots blinking. Click on them.

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_ **(Share option must be OPEN)**:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of profile URLs (**one link per row**).

You can also specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the API and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, follow Phantombuster's team.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you just have to customize it to make it work repetitively.

Every time the API is launched, it will send follow 10 profiles and stop. (You can lower this value in the API's configuration.)

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/repetition-setup.png)</center>

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page.

<center>![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/phantombuster-static/api-store/LinkedIn_Network_Booster/welcome+nerd+zone.gif)</center>


There you go, you only have to wait for the API to follow people for you!


# Email discovery (optional) { email_discovery }

**Thanks to our friends at [Hunter](https://hunter.io) (an email discovery service), this API can guess the email of each profile it visits.**

To use this feature, first create an account at Hunter [here](https://hunter.io/users/sign_up). Once done, **get your Hunter API key** by going to "Dashboard" > "API" > "Copy API key".

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/hunter-screenshot.png)</center>

Paste your API key in the "Hunter.io API key" field in your API configuration. It will now guess the email of every visited profile! Expect a success rate between 20% and 50%.

Hunter gives you 100 free email guesses per month. After that, you'll have to buy one of their plans or wait a month.

**Important note:** When email discovery is enabled, the API will open LinkedIn company pages to get company domains. For this reason, we recommend you limit your visits to **40 profiles per day**.

# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our LinkedIn APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf. Like *Uncle Ben* once said, *"With great power comes great responsibility."*

We have noticed that visiting more than 80 profiles per day will almost always result in LinkedIn **invalidating your session cookie** (that is, logging you out). We recommend no more than 8 launches per day of 10 scraped profiles for this reason.

**Note:** When [email discovery](#section_email_discovery) is enabled, we recommend you divide this limit by 2 (that is, **40 profiles per day**).

Having a LinkedIn Premium subscription might raise this limit. Please see these official LinkedIn help pages: [Commercial Use Limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950) and [Finding People on LinkedIn](https://premium.linkedin.com/professional/faq).
