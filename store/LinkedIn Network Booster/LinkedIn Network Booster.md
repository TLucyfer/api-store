# Tutorial

If you haven't already, create a **FREE** account on [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/register). Our service will browse the web for you. It‚Äôs a website automator which runs in the cloud. Once done we'll follow up.


## 2. Use this API on your account.üëå
We cooked up in our lab a script with first-class attention.

## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to LinkedIn on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet üìë
Below your session cookie you‚Äôll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_ **(Share option must be OPEN)**:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of profile URLs to add (**one link per row**).

You can also specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.

## 6. (Optional) Add a private personalized message üÜï üí¨
Below the column name you'll find the **message** configuration. This step isn‚Äôt mandatory but highly recommended.

In the message textbox you can write a private note (**Total: 300 characters MAX**) which will be sent to the profile included in your Google spreadsheet list in addition to the invitation to join your network.

**\#firstName\#** will be replaced in your message by the first name of the person you‚Äôre adding.

Many other replacement tags are available, like **\#company\#**, **\#jobTitle\#** and **\#school\#**. In fact, you can use any column you want from the output CSV. (Note: you have to enable scraping by not checking the last checkbox for these tags to be available.)

How about using your own tags ? <b>Simple.</b>
Add a column in your Google Spreadsheet with any informations you want to apply.

For instance:
A column named **greetings** in your Google Spreadsheet will replace all **\#greetings\#** tags in your message

Click on üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span>


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It‚Äôs done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the API and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, send Phantombuster's team LinkedIn connection requests.

# Email discovery (optional) { email_discovery }

LinkedIn allows its users access to the email addresses of their 1st degree connections. 

However, if you‚Äôre looking for the email addresses of people you‚Äôre not connected to, picking an email discovery services is paramount.

As a Phantombuster user, you have a daily limit of email requests. (You can see that figure down below next to your execution time).

Use your credit by selecting "Phantombuster" as your email discovery service.

Already have a subscription with another data enrichment service such as [Dropcontact.io](https://dropcontact.io) or [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)? Select a service and past your API key in the field below.

# ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏èRepetition setup ‚öôÔ∏è

Now that your API is ready, you just have to customize it to make it work repetitively.

Every time the API is launched, it will send 10 connection requests and stop. (You can lower this value in the API's configuration.)

To do so, simply hit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button to define when your API is launched.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

Now that this is set, click üíæ <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page.

There you go, you only have to wait for connections to be made for you!

# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our LinkedIn APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf. Like *Uncle Ben* once said, *"With great power comes great responsibility."*

We have noticed that adding more than 80 connections per day will almost always result in LinkedIn **invalidating your session cookie** (that is, logging you out). We recommend no more than 8 launches per day of 10 connection requests for this reason.

**Note:** When [email discovery](#section_email_discovery) is enabled, we recommend you divide this limit by 2 (that is, **40 profiles per day**).

Having a LinkedIn Premium subscription might raise this limit. Please see these official LinkedIn help pages: [Commercial Use Limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950) and [Finding People on LinkedIn](https://premium.linkedin.com/professional/faq).
